# OLD CARTERIDGES 1-9  (APOGEE CARTRIDGES)

# WARNING: there are many notes in here refering to the SDSS-I guide camera,
# and/or to the new APO Alta camera: those notes should be removed, and
# any measurements that may have been based on them replaced with new
# appropriate measurements for LCO.

# The x,y values have been transformed from Dan Long's values
# to Andor values using the transformations measured for cartridge 1
# They should be close, but updated to more precise values
# measured with a star offset pattern.
#
#ROTATION
#The rotation can be determined to +-15 degrees without being on the sky
#Plug the guide fibers into the special rotation measurement plate #35xxx
#Look at the output of the fibes with an eye piece, all should show some occultation
#Photograph the fiber output block, Dan Long is the expert on this.
#(if no camera available (note the orientation of the obstruction viewed by eye on a sketch)
#Measure the angle from what would be the guider rotation axis to the pin.
#This can be done in photoshop, or a cad package, or with a protractor
#
#There are 2 angles necessary to define the relationship between
#the X axis on the guider and N on the fiber.
#
#(A) The angle described above but as viewed by the guide camera
#    and measured CCW from the guider X axis. Thus the angle theta
#    is the angle CCW from the guider x axis to the alignment pin
#    if it could be seen on the the guider image.
#
#(B) The angle phi defined as orientation of the alignment pin and the
#    guide hole. Derived from deltaX and deltaY in plate coords (N=Y), (E=X)
#    viewed form the sky side of the plate. tan (phi) = dy/dx, phi=atan2(dy,dx)
#    thus the angle x ccw through y in a RH coords
#    This angle is calculated from the x,yfocal in the plPlugmapM file
#
#A third angle is required to get to Az Alt coords
#
#  Note the pin angle phi for fiber in the North half of the plate are
#  typically 0+-20deg, and 180+-20 for the South half.
#  The deviation from 0 or 180 depends on the hole location on the plate
#  relative to the anchor point location, and its set to minimize torque
#  on the fiber.
